## Turn Structure

Phases are defined by the `TurnPhase` type: `'draw' | 'player_action' | 'enemy_turn' | 'turn_end' | 'encounter_end'`.

The encounter begins with `startEncounter()`: initializes `TurnState`, resets chain/aura/review-queue, draws 5 opening cards via `drawHand()`.

**Player action phase:** Player calls `playCardAction()` repeatedly until AP is exhausted, then calls `endPlayerTurn()`.

**`endPlayerTurn()` executes in order:**
1. `onPlayerNoCharge` enemy callback (if player made no Charge plays)
2. `dispatchEnemyTurnStart()` — enrage and Brain Fog hooks
3. `enemy.block = 0` — enemy block decays
4. `executeEnemyIntent()` — enemy attacks/defends/buffs (or skipped if staggered/slowed)
5. `takeDamage(playerState)` — shield absorbs first, then HP
6. `resolveLethalEffects()` — death-save relic checks (`last_breath`, `phoenix_feather`)
7. `tickPlayerStatusEffects()` — poison/regen tick on player
8. `tickEnemyStatusEffects()` — poison tick on enemy; Bleed decays by `BLEED_DECAY_PER_TURN`
9. `resolveTurnEndEffects()` — relic hooks (perfect turn bonus, etc.)
10. `resetTurnState(playerState)` — shield decays, AP refills, chain resets
11. `drawHand()` — draw 5 new cards for next turn

**Turn counters:** `turnNumber` is global (run-level, drives Surge system); `encounterTurnNumber` resets to 1 per encounter (drives enrage system).

## AP (Action Points) System

| Constant | Value |
|---|---|
| `START_AP_PER_TURN` | 3 |
| `MAX_AP_PER_TURN` | 5 |
| Normal card cost | `card.apCost` |
| Charge surcharge | +1 AP added to `apCost` |
| `FIRST_CHARGE_FREE_AP_SURCHARGE` | 0 (first attempt at a fact is free) |

Charge plays add +1 AP surcharge. Surcharge waivers (checked in priority order in `playCardAction`):
1. **Surge turn** — `getSurgeChargeSurcharge(turnNumber) === 0`; fires every `SURGE_INTERVAL (4)` turns starting at `SURGE_FIRST_TURN (2)`
2. **Warcry buff** — `warcryFreeChargeActive` flag (consumed on use)
3. **Chain Momentum** — `CHAIN_MOMENTUM_ENABLED = true`; previous correct Charge waives surcharge for next same chain-type Charge
4. **Free First Charge** — `isFirstChargeFree(factId, ...)` — first attempt at any fact in the run costs +0 surcharge

If `apCurrent < apCost`, card is blocked (`blocked: true`, no AP deducted).

## Damage Pipeline

Computed in `resolveCardEffect()` (`cardEffectResolver.ts`):

1. **Mechanic base** — `mechanic.quickPlayValue` (QP) or `quickPlayValue * CHARGE_CORRECT_MULTIPLIER` (CC = 1.5×) or `mechanic.chargeWrongValue` (CW)
2. **Mastery bonus** — `getMasteryBaseBonus(mechanicId, masteryLevel)` added flat
3. **Cursed multipliers** (if `card.isCursed`) — QP: 0.7×, CC: 1.0×, CW: 0.5×
4. **Inscription of Fury bonus** — flat add for attack cards from `activeInscriptions`
5. **Speed/trick bonus** — speed bonus (1.5× if answered fast) × trick question unlock (2.0×)
6. **Combo multipliers** — `chainMultiplier × overclockMultiplier × buffMultiplier`
7. **Relic modifiers** — `resolveAttackModifiers()` / `resolveShieldModifiers()`
8. **Enemy modifiers** — QP damage multiplier, hardcover armor, `chargeResistant` (−50% QP), `chainVulnerable` (+50% chain damage)
9. **Burn trigger** — `triggerBurn()`: bonus = current stacks, then stacks halve (multi-hit fires per hit)
10. **Bleed bonus** — `getBleedBonus()`: flat `BLEED_BONUS_PER_STACK` per stack

Final damage: `applyDamageToEnemy(enemy, damageDealt)`. Enemy HP ≤ 0 → `result = 'victory'`.

**Tier multipliers** (legacy path, no mechanic definition): T1=1.0×, T2a=1.3×, T2b=1.6×, T3=0×.

**Knowledge Chain multipliers** (`CHAIN_MULTIPLIERS`): [1.0, 1.0, 1.3, 1.7, 2.2, 3.0] at chain lengths 0–5.

## Play Modes

**Quick Play (`playMode = 'quick'`)**
- No quiz; fires at `mechanic.quickPlayValue`
- No +1 AP surcharge
- Breaks the Knowledge Chain
- Locked cards (Trick Question) cannot be played Quick

**Charge Correct (`playMode = 'charge'`, `answeredCorrectly = true`)**
- Damage = `quickPlayValue * 1.5` + mastery bonus
- Extends Knowledge Chain
- Mastery upgrade eligible
- Costs `apCost + 1` (with waivers)
- Decrements fog by 1 (`adjustAura(-1)`)
- Clears fact from review queue

**Charge Wrong (`playMode = 'charge'`, `answeredCorrectly = false`)**
- Partial effect at `FIZZLE_EFFECT_RATIO` (0.25× of base effect by default)
- Free First Charge wrong = 0.0× (total fizzle, `FIRST_CHARGE_FREE_WRONG_MULTIPLIER`)
- Breaks Knowledge Chain, loses Chain Momentum
- Mastery downgrade (skipped on first attempt at a fact, `isFirstAttempt` flag)
- Adds fact to `cursedFactIds` if `masteryLevel === 0` and not first attempt
- Increases fog by 2 (`adjustAura(2)`)
- AP deducted — no refund on wrong answer

## Win/Lose Conditions

**Victory:** `enemy.currentHP <= 0` via `applyDamageToEnemy()` or status ticks. Sets `result = 'victory'`, `phase = 'encounter_end'`.

**Defeat:** `playerState.hp <= 0` after `takeDamage()` or poison ticks. `resolveLethalEffects()` checked first — `last_breath` relic saves to 1 HP (once per encounter); `phoenix_feather` saves to a % of maxHP and grants 1 turn of auto-Charge. If no save: `result = 'defeat'`, `phase = 'encounter_end'`.

---

## Shield (Block)

- `applyShield(state, amount)` — stacks additively
- `takeDamage()` — shield absorbs first, then HP; `immunity` status absorbs after shield
- `resetTurnState()` — shield decays to 0 each turn end
- `persistentShield` — carries over if `fortress_wall` relic's `blockCarries` flag is set
- Enemy block resets to 0 at start of enemy turn — enemies must re-defend each turn

---

## Enrage System

`getEnrageBonus(encounterTurnNumber, floor, enemyHpPercent)` returns flat bonus added to all enemy attacks.

Uses `ENRAGE_SEGMENTS` (floor-based): Phase 1 ramps at `ENRAGE_PHASE1_BONUS` per turn for `ENRAGE_PHASE1_DURATION` turns; Phase 2 escalates faster. Enemies below `ENRAGE_LOW_HP_THRESHOLD` (30%) deal an extra `ENRAGE_LOW_HP_BONUS` regardless of segment.
