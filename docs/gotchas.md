### 2026-04-03 — Vite Cache Corruption After Dev Server Restart

**What happened:** After restarting the dev server (`npm run dev`) to pick up new static assets in `public/`, the hub camp sprites rendered at full viewport size instead of their normal portrait-constrained layout. The `.hub-landscape` CSS rule (`position: fixed; inset: 0; display: flex; overflow: hidden`) was completely missing from the compiled CSS — Svelte's scoped class hash changed but the old compiled output was served from cache.

**Root cause:** Stale Vite transform cache in `node_modules/.vite`. When the dev server restarts, Svelte component CSS scope hashes can change, but Vite may serve stale compiled modules where the hash doesn't match.

**Fix:** Clear the Vite cache before restarting:
```bash
rm -rf node_modules/.vite && npm run dev
```

**Rule:** Always clear `node_modules/.vite` when restarting the dev server, especially after adding new files to `public/` or after the server was killed and restarted. A hard browser refresh (Cmd+Shift+R) alone is NOT sufficient — the corruption is server-side.

**What to keep:** `card.tier` field stays on the Card interface (quiz difficulty uses it). `isMastered = card.tier === '3'` check stays (hides charge button on fully memorized cards). `card-tier-label--mastered` ("MASTERED" text label) stays as informational text. All mastery glow/color logic (`hasMasteryGlow()`, `getMasteryIconFilter()`) stays unchanged.

### 2026-04-04 — Pool Homogeneity Check Added (Check #20)

**What:** Added check #20 to `scripts/verify-all-decks.mjs` detecting answer pools where the max/min length ratio of non-bracket answers exceeds 3x (FAIL) or 2x (WARN). This catches pools mixing very short answers ("Sue", 3 chars) with long answers ("Brachiosaurus skeleton", 20+ chars) — these make the correct answer trivially guessable.

**Why it matters:** The quiz-audit.mjs length_mismatch check only fires per-fact when a specific question is sampled. The new check #20 fires at the pool level in the structural verifier, catching the root cause: the pool itself is heterogeneous. Pool homogeneity failures are widespread across existing decks (virtually every knowledge deck has at least one).

**Remediation status:** All existing decks fail check #20. Remediation requires splitting broad pools (e.g. `person_names`) into domain-specific sub-pools, or adding `syntheticDistractors` to fill the gap. The corresponding unit test (`pool members should have similar answer lengths` in `deck-content-quality.test.ts`) is currently `it.skip` until batch remediation is complete.

**Thresholds:**
- `verify-all-decks.mjs` check #20: FAIL > 3x ratio, WARN > 2x ratio (per pool)
- `deck-content-quality.test.ts`: 4x ratio threshold (more lenient, unskip after remediation)

**Bracket-number answers are excluded** from both checks — numerical distractors are generated algorithmically and always match in length.

### 2026-04-04 — quiz-audit.mjs Generates False Positives for Pools with Duplicate Answers

**What happened:** Running `node scripts/quiz-audit.mjs --deck solar_system --full` reported 58 failures — "Distractor matches correct answer" and "Duplicate distractors in selection". For the planet_names pool (39 facts, 10 unique planet answers), the audit was selecting "Jupiter" as a distractor for Jupiter facts.

**Root cause:** `quiz-audit.mjs` simulates distractor selection by pulling from `poolFacts.filter(f => f.id !== fact.id)` — filtering by fact ID, not by answer value. The real game service (`curatedDistractorSelector.ts`) deduplicates by `correctAnswer` using a `seenAnswers` Set before including any candidate. The audit's simulation doesn't match the real deduplication logic.

**Impact:** Any pool with multiple facts sharing the same correct answer (e.g., planet_names has ~5 Jupiter facts, ~5 Venus facts) will produce false-positive "answer in distractors" failures in the quiz audit. The actual game never shows the correct answer as a distractor.

**Fix:** Treat quiz-audit failures of type `answer_in_distractors` and `duplicate_distractors` on pools with known answer duplication as false positives. The real test is whether the real `selectDistractors` service produces valid distractors — which it does because it deduplicates by answer value.

**What to watch for:** The quiz-audit tool DOES correctly detect: length mismatches, em-dash in answers, too-few distractors, long answers. Only the distractor-collision checks are potentially false positives when a pool has multiple facts with the same answer.

**Future fix:** Update `quiz-audit.mjs` to deduplicate by answer value when building the distractor candidate pool, matching the real game service behavior.

### 2026-04-04 — quiz-audit.mjs False Positives Fixed (Deduplication by Answer Text)

**What:** Fixed `quiz-audit.mjs` to deduplicate pool distractors by answer text (not just by fact ID), matching the actual game service behavior (`getPoolDistractors` in `verify-all-decks.mjs` and the runtime `curatedDistractorSelector.ts`).

**Fix applied:** In `checkFact()`, replaced the naive `.filter(f => f.id !== fact.id).map(...)` with a loop that tracks `seenAnswers` (a Set initialized with the correct answer). This prevents pools with many facts sharing the same answer (e.g. 20 "Late Cretaceous" facts in geological_periods) from producing false-positive "answer_in_distractors" and "duplicate_distractors" failures.

**Impact:** Eliminated all false-positive failures across knowledge decks. The solar_system deck had 58 such false positives from planet_names pool; geological_periods in dinosaurs had ~15.

**Rule:** When building pool distractor simulations, ALWAYS deduplicate by answer value before the pick step — not just by fact ID.

### 2026-04-04 — Dinosaurs Deck Pool Homogeneity Remediation

**What:** Fixed the `dinosaurs` deck pool structure to resolve the 6.3x FAIL on `dinosaur_names` pool (Sue/3ch vs Carcharodontosaurus/19ch).

**Changes made:**
1. Created new `misc_concepts` pool for facts whose answers don't fit other named categories: specimen names (Sue), diet terms (Fish, Herbivore), comparison animals (Giraffe), geographical terms (China, Pangaea), booleans (False), anatomical features (Teeth), and date ranges (252–201, 201–145, 145–66).
2. Moved `Roy Chapman Andrews` from `dinosaur_names` to `paleontologist_names` (19ch fits the 11-22ch range of that pool).
3. Removed "False" boolean from `clade_names` — it was a True/False answer in a pool of clade/group names.
4. Set `minimumSize: 3` on `clade_names` (now has 3 facts: Pterosaur, Monitor lizard, Live young).
5. Moved 3 date-range facts (dino_triassic_dates, dino_jurassic_dates, dino_cretaceous_dates) from `bracket_numbers` to `misc_concepts` — their "252–201" style answers are plain strings, not bracket numbers, and caused length_mismatch FAILs in quiz-audit.
6. Moved `dino_archaeopteryx_teeth` ("Teeth") from `clade_names` to `misc_concepts`.
7. Expanded `paleontologist_names.syntheticDistractors` from 7 to 14 entries (added Xu Xing, William Buckland, Gideon Mantell, Harry Seeley, Friedrich von Huene, Werner Janensch, Paul Sereno).

**Result:** `dinosaur_names` ratio: 6.3x FAIL → 2.4x WARN. Quiz audit: 17 fails → 0 fails (full mode). Structural verifier: 0 fails, 2 warns.

**Rule:** When a pool has ratio > 3x, the outlier answer type should be identified and moved to a semantically appropriate pool. Don't just add syntheticDistractors — fix the pool membership.

### 2026-04-04 — AP World History Pool Homogeneity: verify-all-decks `displayAnswer` only strips FIRST brace pair

**What:** Fact `apwh_4_063` had `correctAnswer: "{1519}–{1522}"`. Appeared fine in manual testing (`displayAnswer` strips `{digits}`) but `verify-all-decks.mjs` flagged "Answer contains literal braces after display stripping."

**Root cause:** The verifier's `displayAnswer` uses `/\{(\d[\d,]*\.?\d*)\}/` **without the `g` flag**, so it only strips the first `{1519}` — leaving `{1522}` in place. The UI runtime's `displayAnswer` also lacks `g` (same regex), so both-brace answers would display as `1519–{1522}` in-game.

**Fix:** Changed answer to `"Departed 1519, returned 1522"` to match the distractor format and avoid double-brace notation entirely.

**Rule:** Never use multiple `{N}` brace markers in a single `correctAnswer` field. Use plain concatenated text (e.g., "Departed 1519, returned 1522") or a single brace marker only.

### 2026-04-04 — Pool Homogeneity: Expanding Short Answers to Reach Min Length

**What:** AP World History `concept_terms` pool (297 facts) had 82 facts under 22 chars. With max=65, needed min >= 22 to achieve ratio < 3x.

**Approach:** Added context parentheticals to each short answer (e.g., `Manorialism` → `Manorialism (feudal land system)`, `Janissaries` → `Janissaries (Ottoman slave soldiers)`). Preserved originals in `acceptableAlternatives`.

**Key insight:** Reverting parenthetical expansions later will break the pool again. If you add context parentheticals to reach a pool minimum, the `acceptableAlternatives` field is the correct place for the original bare answer — not the other way around.

**Rule:** When fixing pool homogeneity by expanding short answers, keep expanded form as `correctAnswer` and original as `acceptableAlternative`. Do NOT revert the expansion even if it causes in-game distractor length mismatch — fix the distractors instead.
