### 2026-04-03 — Vite Cache Corruption After Dev Server Restart

**What happened:** After restarting the dev server (`npm run dev`) to pick up new static assets in `public/`, the hub camp sprites rendered at full viewport size instead of their normal portrait-constrained layout. The `.hub-landscape` CSS rule (`position: fixed; inset: 0; display: flex; overflow: hidden`) was completely missing from the compiled CSS — Svelte's scoped class hash changed but the old compiled output was served from cache.

**Root cause:** Stale Vite transform cache in `node_modules/.vite`. When the dev server restarts, Svelte component CSS scope hashes can change, but Vite may serve stale compiled modules where the hash doesn't match.

**Fix:** Clear the Vite cache before restarting:
```bash
rm -rf node_modules/.vite && npm run dev
```

**Rule:** Always clear `node_modules/.vite` when restarting the dev server, especially after adding new files to `public/` or after the server was killed and restarted. A hard browser refresh (Cmd+Shift+R) alone is NOT sufficient — the corruption is server-side.

**What to keep:** `card.tier` field stays on the Card interface (quiz difficulty uses it). `isMastered = card.tier === '3'` check stays (hides charge button on fully memorized cards). `card-tier-label--mastered` ("MASTERED" text label) stays as informational text. All mastery glow/color logic (`hasMasteryGlow()`, `getMasteryIconFilter()`) stays unchanged.
