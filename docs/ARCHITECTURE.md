# Recall Rogue Architecture (V6 — Card Roguelite)

Every card is a fact. Learning IS gameplay.

## 1. System Overview

```
Tech Stack: Vite 7 + Svelte 5 + TypeScript 5.9 + Phaser 3 + Capacitor (Android/iOS)
Three game systems: Card Combat, Deck Building, Run Progression
Data: sql.js fact database (4,537 facts, expandable to 20,000+)
Persistence: localStorage (profile-namespaced), optional cloud sync
```

Primary boot path:

1. `src/main.ts` mounts Svelte app, initializes player save.
2. `CardGameManager.boot()` creates Phaser game with `BootScene` and `CombatScene`.
3. `encounterBridge.ts` wires game flow controller into deck/enemy/turn systems and CombatScene display. `startEncounterForRoom()` is async and calls `await factsDB.init()` if the DB is not yet ready (guards against race conditions).
4. `factsDB.init()` loads `public/facts.db` in parallel for quiz/card content.

```

### Phaser Layer

- `CombatScene` — renders enemy HP bars (with block overlay), damage particles, screen flash. Enemy sprites are rendered and animated via EnemySpriteSystem (3D paper cutout effect with procedural idle/attack/hit/death states). Intent, floor info, enemy name, and bounty strip have moved to the Svelte overlay.
- `CombatScene` uses a `sceneReady` guard: a private boolean flag set `true` at end of `create()`. All public methods (`setEnemy`, `updateEnemyBlock`, `setEnemyIntent`, `updatePlayerHP`, `setFloorInfo`, `setRelics`) early-return if the scene is not yet ready, preventing race conditions when callers invoke display updates before Phaser objects exist.
- Sprite pool of 5 pre-created card sprites, repositioned per turn (no create/destroy)
- Particle cap: 50 concurrent max on mobile; correct answer burst = 30 particles, 300ms lifespan
- Scale mode: `Scale.ENVELOP` (fills viewport without gaps)
- Pixel-art config: `pixelArt`, `roundPixels`, `antialias: false`

### Svelte UI Layer

- **Bottom 45% of screen** (interaction zone): card hand (fanned arc), answer buttons, end turn
- **Top 55% of screen** (display zone): enemy, HP bars, intent telegraph, floor counter, relic tray
- All interactive elements below the screen midpoint (thumb-reachable)
- Touch targets: 48x48dp minimum, cards `min(18vw, 85px)` width with 1.5:1 aspect ratio, answer buttons full-width 56dp height
- Card hand fans in a natural arc (low-high-low, center card highest) with 30° total spread and 20px max arc offset
- Two-step commit flow: tap to select (card rises 80px with info overlay) → tap again or swipe up (>60px) to cast → quiz panel appears above hand
- Question panel positioned via `position: fixed; bottom: calc(45vh - 20px)` — no overlap with card hand
- Enemy intent panel, floor info, enemy name header (color-coded by category), and bounty strip (bottom-right, above End Turn) rendered in Svelte overlay — not Phaser
- End Turn button: gold pulsing glow when no actions remain; confirmation popup if AP and playable cards available
- Screen routing via `currentScreen` store in `CardApp.svelte`

#### Card Animation State Machine

After answering a quiz, cards go through a multi-phase CSS animation sequence. State: `CardAnimPhase = 'reveal' | 'mechanic' | 'launch' | 'fizzle' | null`.

- **Reveal** (400ms): Card enlarges to ~1.8x, centers, CSS 3D `rotateY(180deg)` flip to show cardback art. Skipped if no cardback art available.
- **Mechanic** (500ms): One of 31 mechanic-specific `@keyframes` animations plays (slash, glow, ripple, etc.). Juice effects fire here.
- **Launch** (300ms): Card flies upward, removed from DOM.
- **Fizzle** (400ms, wrong answers only): Shake + fade out.

**Animation buffer pattern**: Cards are copied to an `animatingCards` array before logical removal from the hand. A separate `{#each animatingCards}` loop renders non-interactive copies with animation CSS classes. Cards are cleaned from the buffer after animation completes via `setTimeout`. This prevents cards from disappearing mid-animation when the hand state updates.

**Cardback discovery**: `cardbackManifest.ts` uses `import.meta.glob` at build time to discover which facts have cardback WebP images in `/public/assets/cardbacks/lowres/`. Images are preloaded via Svelte `$effect` when cards enter the hand.

**Reduced motion**: `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` replaces flip + mechanic animations with a simple fade + color flash.

#### Modified Files (P0.6)

**Data Layer:**
- `src/data/card-types.ts` — Added `isUpgraded?: boolean` and `secondaryValue?: number` to Card interface
- `src/data/balance.ts` — Added upgrade, shop, and synergy constants (UPGRADE_DEFS, SHOP_PRICES, RELIC_SYNERGIES, SYNERGY_BONUSES)

**Service Layer:**
- `src/services/encounterBridge.ts` — Wired `generateCurrencyReward()` for gold after encounters; added `upgradeCardInActiveDeck()` handler
- `src/services/gameFlowController.ts` — Added upgrade flow states, shop buy handlers, post-mini-boss rest routing
- `src/services/relicEffectResolver.ts` — Integrated Tier 2 synergy bonus checks via `hasSynergy()` during effect resolution
- `src/services/turnManager.ts` — Added Tier 3 synergy tracking: `consecutiveCorrectThisEncounter`, `tier3CardCount`, `phoenixRageTurnsRemaining`, `glassPenaltyRemovedTurnsRemaining`
- `src/services/runManager.ts` — Added `cardsUpgraded: number` to RunState tracking
- `src/services/cardEffectResolver.ts` — Updated multi_hit/reckless/execute to use per-card `secondaryValue`; quicken+ draws 1 extra card

**UI Layer:**
- `src/ui/stores/gameState.ts` — Added `upgradeSelection`, `postMiniBossRest` screens; added `synergyFlash` store for visual feedback
- `src/ui/components/CardHand.svelte` — Added `.card-upgraded` CSS class (blue glow border)
- `src/ui/components/RestRoomOverlay.svelte` — Wired upgrade button (removed "Coming soon" stub)
- `src/ui/components/ShopRoomOverlay.svelte` — Complete redesign with buy relics, buy cards, and sell sections
- `src/ui/components/CardCombatOverlay.svelte` — Added synergy flash UI element for visual feedback

**Data Flow Additions:**
- **Upgrade flow**: Rest Room → `openUpgradeSelection()` → UpgradeSelectionOverlay → `onUpgradeSelected(cardId)` → mutates card in deck → proceeds
- **Shop buy flow**: Shop Room → `onShopBuyRelic(relicId)` / `onShopBuyCard(index)` → deducts gold, adds item → updates display
- **Synergy detection**: `relicSynergyResolver.detectActiveSynergies()` called at encounter start → bonuses applied in `relicEffectResolver` (Tier 2) and `turnManager` (Tier 3)

### Relic System

The relic system uses an STS-inspired economy replacing the old FSRS-tied passive relics.

**Data layer** (`src/data/relics/`):
- `types.ts` — `RelicDefinition`, `RunRelic`, `RelicRarity`, `RelicCategory`, `RelicTrigger`
- `starters.ts` — 25 free starter relic definitions
- `unlockable.ts` — 25 unlockable relic definitions
- `index.ts` — barrel exports, `FULL_RELIC_CATALOGUE`, `RELIC_BY_ID`, `STARTER_RELIC_IDS`

**Services**:
- `relicEffectResolver.ts` — Pure functions resolving relic effects from `Set<string>` of held IDs. Hooks: encounter start, attack, shield, heal, damage taken, lethal, turn end, perfect turn, correct answer, card skip, draw count, combo start, speed bonus, echo, timer.
- `relicAcquisitionService.ts` — In-run pool filtering, weighted random selection, boss/mini-boss choice generation, random drop logic.

**UI components**:
- `RelicCollectionScreen.svelte` — Hub screen (via Anvil) for browsing, unlocking, and excluding relics
- `RelicRewardScreen.svelte` — Full-screen 1-of-3 relic choice (boss/first mini-boss)
- `RelicPickupToast.svelte` — Brief toast for random relic drops
- `RelicTray.svelte` — Combat HUD horizontal relic display (no dormancy)

**Integration points** (all combat-loop relic checks now delegate to `relicEffectResolver.ts` as the centralized source of truth):
- `encounterBridge.ts` — Builds `activeRelicIds` from `runRelics` at encounter start; delegates encounter-start effects (herbal_pouch, quicksilver), draw count (swift_boots, blood_price), and combo start (combo_ring) to resolver
- `turnManager.ts` — Delegates turn-start effects (iron_buckler: +3 block/turn), damage-taken effects (steel_skin, thorned_vest, glass_cannon, iron_resolve), lethal saves (last_breath, phoenix_feather), turn-end effects (fortress_wall, afterimage, blood_pact, blood_price), and perfect-turn bonuses (momentum_gem) to resolver
- `cardEffectResolver.ts` — Per-card relic modifiers (attack bonus, strike bonus, echo power, chain lightning)
- `gameFlowController.ts` — Relic acquisition flow after encounters, relic reward routing
- `playerData.ts` — `awardMasteryCoin()`, `spendMasteryCoins()`, `unlockRelic()`, `toggleRelicExclusion()`
- `saveService.ts` — Backward-compatible migration: retroactive mastery coins from Tier 3 facts

### Planned (P1)

| System | Description | Planned Location |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| MasteryManager | Tier 1→2→3 evolution, tier-up ceremony UI | `src/services/masteryManager.ts` |
| Cash-out screen | Surface-or-continue risk/reward at segment checkpoints | `src/ui/components/CashOut.svelte` |
| Knowledge Library | Fact collection/mastery view | `src/ui/components/KnowledgeLibrary.svelte` |
| StreakTracker | Daily streak logic | `src/services/streakTracker.ts` |
| Canary system | Adaptive difficulty (per-player, per-domain) | `src/services/canarySystem.ts` |

### P2+ — Post-Launch

- Endless mode, cosmetic store (Treasure Chest sprite → dedicated shop), language pack support

## 5. Archived Systems

Mining-specific code moved to `src/_archived-mining/`. Stub files remain at original paths for import compatibility.

Archived systems include: mining grid, block breaking, fog of war, O2 system, mine generation, biome rendering, hazard system, mine block interactor, dome scene (hub world), creature spawner, instability system.

## 6. Data Flow

### Run Lifecycle

```
Study Mode Selection (hub dropdown: All Topics, saved preset, language, or Build New Deck)
  → PresetPoolBuilder resolves selected mode into domain + subcategory filters
  → MasteryScalingService calculates deck mastery % and applies reward/timer scaling
  → RunPoolBuilder builds 120-fact pool from resolved domains (30/25/45 split, subcategory-balanced) or preset-weighted
  → DeckManager shuffles pool into draw pile
  → Floor 1 begins

Combat Loop (per encounter):
  1. Draw 5 cards from draw pile (Tier 3 extracted as passives)
  2. Player taps card → question appears (3 answer options)
  3. Correct → card effect activates (damage/heal/shield + passive bonuses), SM-2 update via encounterBridge
     Wrong → card fizzles (gentle dissolve), correct answer shown 2s, SM-2 update
  4. Enemy turn → telegraphed attack executes, passive heal/regen applied at turn boundary
  5. Repeat until enemy HP = 0 or player HP = 0

Between Encounters:
  → Room selection (3 choices: enemy, mystery, rest, shop, elite)
  → Card reward (pick 1 of 3 new cards)

Segment Checkpoint (every 3 floors):
  → Cash-out-or-continue decision
  → Boss encounter if continuing

Run End:
  → Post-run summary (facts learned, cards earned, floor reached)
  → SM-2 states persisted, meta-progression applied
  → Return to hub
```

### Store Architecture

- `src/ui/stores/gameState.ts` — current screen, run state, combat state
- `src/ui/stores/playerData.ts` — save data, SM-2 states, achievements
- Phaser `CombatScene` owns transient combat state (enemy HP, animations)
- `saveService` persists `PlayerSave` to localStorage (profile-namespaced)

## 7. State Management

| State Type | Owner | Persistence |
|------------|-------|-------------|
| UI navigation | Svelte stores (`currentScreen`) | Session only |
| Run progress | RunManager → Svelte store | Saved after every encounter |
| Combat state | CombatScene + encounter engine | Transient (rebuilt from run state) |
| Card/deck state | DeckManager | Saved as part of run state |
| SM-2 review data | playerData store | Persisted in PlayerSave |
| Meta-progression | playerData store | Persisted in PlayerSave |
| Study presets | studyPresetService | localStorage (up to 10 named presets) |
| Selected study mode | gameFlowController | Saved per-run, previous mode remembered |
| Settings | settings store | localStorage |

Run state serialization target: <50KB (SM-2 data for 500 facts ≈ 25KB).

## 8. Performance Budget

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Active game objects in combat | ~12 (1 background, 1 enemy, 5 cards, 2 HP bars, 1 combo counter, 1 particle emitter, 1 intent icon) |
| Concurrent particles | 50 max |
| Frame rate | 60fps |
| Run state size | <50KB |
| Texture atlases in memory | 3 max (via TextureAtlasLRU) |
| Card animations | CSS 3D transforms + @keyframes (31 mechanic animations, GPU-accelerated via `will-change: transform`) |

## 9. Typed Event Bus

Two buses:

- **Global**: `src/events/EventBus.ts` — typed payloads in `src/events/types.ts`. Supports `emit`, `emitAsync`, `on`, `off`, `clear`. Will extend with card combat events (`card-played`, `card-fizzled`, `encounter-won`, `floor-cleared`, `run-ended`).
- **Encounter bridge**: `encounterBridge.ts` wires game flow controller into deck/enemy/turn systems and CombatScene display. `startEncounterForRoom()` is async; callers in `CardApp.svelte` and `gameFlowController.ts` await it.

## 10. Save/Load Architecture

- Full save: `PlayerSave` in `src/data/types.ts`
- Save key: `terra_save_<profileId>` (fallback: `terra_save`)
- Mid-run checkpoint: saved after every encounter (replaces mid-dive snapshot)
- Save version migrations: in-code, field-by-field in `saveService.ts`
- Optional sub-document split: `saveSubDocs.ts` (core, knowledge, inventory, analytics)
- Optional cloud sync: `syncService`/`apiClient`

## 13. Content Pipeline Architecture

```
Raw Data Sources (Wikidata, APIs, manual)
    ↓
Haiku Agent Transform (Claude Code Agent tool, model: "haiku")
  - Assesses fact worth (rejects boring/trivial)
  - Writes quiz question, answer, distractors, explanation
  - Scores funScore (1-10), difficulty (1-5)
  - Generates 2+ variants
  - Marks _haikuProcessed: true
    ↓
QA Validation (automated scripts)
  - Distractor blocklist enforcement
  - Format validation (question length, answer completeness)
  - _haikuProcessed flag check
  - Taxonomy validation (categoryL2)
    ↓
Promotion to Database
  - promote-approved-to-db.mjs (enforce-qa-gate: true)
  - build-facts-db.mjs → public/facts.db + seed-pack.json
```

### Key Files

- `scripts/content-pipeline/qa/promote-approved-to-db.mjs` — QA gate + promotion engine
- `scripts/content-pipeline/qa/audit-fact-quality.mjs` — Quality audit with blocklist validation
- `scripts/build-facts-db.mjs` — SQLite DB builder + seed-pack generator
- `src/data/seed/*.json` — Seed fact files (source of truth)
- `.claude/skills/manual-fact-ingest-dedup/SKILL.md` — Full pipeline skill documentation

### Processing Requirements

All facts MUST pass through Haiku agent processing:
- **Input validation**: Schema compliance, required fields present
- **Haiku transform**: Question/answers/variants/scoring via Agent tool
- **QA enforcement**: Blocklist check, format validation, `_haikuProcessed: true` flag required
- **No external APIs**: All processing uses Claude Code Agent tool, never `@anthropic-ai/sdk`

## 13.5. Japanese Language Content Pipeline

Parallel pipeline for extracting and merging JLPT-structured Japanese facts (vocabulary, kanji, grammar, kana).

### Source Files

- `data/references/full-japanese-study-deck/` — Cloned FJSD repo with:
  - Vocab IDs mapped to JLPT levels (N5–N1)
  - `kanji-info.json` — radical mappings, stroke count, JLPT assignment
  - `grammar.json` — grammar patterns, JLPT levels, example sentences
  - `kana.json` — hiragana, katakana, extended kana (dakuten, handakuten)
- `data/references/jmdict/jmdict-eng.json` — JMdict English dictionary (215,611 entries, CC-BY-SA 4.0)
- `data/raw/japanese/` — Extracted per-subdeck JSON files:
  - `vocabulary.json` — 10,013 vocab facts with JLPT level, part-of-speech, example sentence
  - `kanji.json` — 2,096 kanji facts with radical, stroke count, JLPT assignment
  - `grammar.json` — 644 grammar pattern facts with JLPT level
  - `kana.json` — 372 kana facts (hiragana, katakana, extended)

### Extraction Script

**File:** `scripts/content-pipeline/vocab/extract-fjsd-japanese.mjs`

**Input:** FJSD repo + JMdict dictionary
**Output:** `data/raw/japanese/*.json` per subdeck

**Process:**
1. Read FJSD vocab list → parse JLPT level assignments
2. Cross-reference JMdict for English meanings and example sentences
3. Normalize schema to Quiz fact structure: question, answers (3 options), explanation, fun score, difficulty
4. Separate into 4 subdecks (vocabulary, kanji, grammar, kana) per JLPT level
5. Write to `data/raw/japanese/*.json`

### Merge Script

**File:** `scripts/content-pipeline/vocab/merge-japanese-facts.mjs`

**Input:** `data/raw/japanese/*.json` per subdeck
**Output:** Facts appended to `src/data/seed/facts-generated.json`

**Process:**
1. Read all `data/raw/japanese/*.json` files
2. For each fact:
   - Add `targetLanguage: 'ja'`, `subdeck: 'vocabulary'|'kanji'|'grammar'|'kana'`
   - Include `jlptLevel` (N5–N1)
   - Generate `visualDescription` using Japanese cultural theming (see GAME_DESIGN.md § 21.5)
   - Create Tier 1 and reverse Tier 2 variants (if applicable)
3. Append to `src/data/seed/facts-generated.json`

### Database Build

**File:** `scripts/build-facts-db.mjs` (unchanged)

**Input:** `src/data/seed/facts-generated.json` (now includes 13,125 Japanese facts)
**Output:** `public/facts.db` + `seed-pack.json`

**Indexing:** Facts indexed by:
- `id` (unique)
- `targetLanguage` = 'ja'
- `subdeck` ∈ {vocabulary, kanji, grammar, kana}
- `jlptLevel` ∈ {N5, N4, N3, N2, N1}

Enables filtered queries: `SELECT * FROM facts WHERE targetLanguage='ja' AND jlptLevel='N5'`

### Data Flow Diagram

```
FJSD repo (vocab.json, kanji-info.json, grammar.json, kana.json)
+ JMdict (jmdict-eng.json, 215K entries)
  ↓
extract-fjsd-japanese.mjs
  ├→ Parse vocab IDs + JLPT mapping
  ├→ Cross-reference JMdict meanings
  ├→ Normalize to Quiz schema
  └→ data/raw/japanese/
     ├→ vocabulary.json (10,013)
     ├→ kanji.json (2,096)
     ├→ grammar.json (644)
     └→ kana.json (372)
  ↓
merge-japanese-facts.mjs
  ├→ Add targetLanguage='ja', subdeck, jlptLevel
  ├→ Generate cultural visualDescriptions
  ├→ Create Tier 1/2 variants
  └→ src/data/seed/facts-generated.json (13,125 appended)
  ↓
build-facts-db.mjs
  ├→ Normalize schemas (correctAnswer, distractors)
  ├→ Index by language, subdeck, JLPT level
  └→ public/facts.db (13,125 Japanese facts searchable)
```

### Versioning & Updates

- FJSD repo pinned to specific commit for reproducibility
- JMdict updated quarterly; version stored in `seed-pack.json` metadata
- Re-run extraction scripts to refresh; `merge-japanese-facts.mjs` deduplicates by ID
- Build cache: clear `public/facts.db` before rebuild if sources changed
