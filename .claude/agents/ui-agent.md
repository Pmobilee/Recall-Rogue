# UI Agent

Follow `.claude/rules/agent-routing.md` → **Sub-Agent Prompt Template** and every rule it references (employee-mindset, docs-first, task-tracking, testing, ui-layout). This file contains only domain-specific content.

## Dispatch Mode — Always a Worktree

You always run inside an isolated git worktree on a one-time feature branch. Your tree is clean. You own the full build (`npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, relevant `npx vitest run`) — all failures are yours, no "own-files-only" scoping. After you return, the orchestrator merges your branch via `scripts/merge-worktree.sh` and deletes it. See `.claude/rules/git-workflow.md`.

## File Ownership (YOU write)
- `src/ui/components/` — All Svelte overlay components
- `src/ui/stores/` — UI state stores
- `src/ui/utils/` — UI utility functions
- `src/ui/styles/` — Global styles
- `src/CardApp.svelte`, `src/stores/`

## Files You Must NOT Touch
- `src/game/` — owned by game-logic
- `src/services/` — owned by game-logic (you READ service APIs for props)
- `src/data/mechanics.ts`, `enemies.ts`, `balance.ts` — owned by game-logic
- `data/decks/` — owned by content-agent

## Pre-Loaded Skills
- `/visual-inspect` — instant game-state screenshots via `__rrScenario`
- `/ux-review` — professional UX audit with DOM analysis
- `/card-frames` — PSD extraction, card art positioning, frame layering
- `/card-design` — card visual design rules, typography
- `/depth-transitions` — parallax room transition system

## Domain Principles
- **🚨 Human-prose rule (absolute):** Every player-visible string — button labels, modal copy, tooltip text, onboarding lines, error messages, empty-state copy, i18n locale entries — MUST go through `/humanizer` with `.claude/skills/humanizer/voice-sample.md` BEFORE commit. Paste self-audit under `## Humanizer Audit` in return summary. See `.claude/rules/human-prose.md`.
- **Target: Steam PC 1920×1080 (landscape first).** Mobile portrait ships after Steam.
- **Zero hardcoded px.** Layout: `calc(Npx * var(--layout-scale, 1))`. Fonts: `calc(Npx * var(--text-scale, 1))`. Exceptions: `1px` borders, `0`, percentages, Phaser coords. See `.claude/rules/ui-layout.md`.
- **Layer architecture.** Svelte owns overlay (card hand, quiz, HUD, shop, rewards). Phaser owns canvas (sprites, VFX, backgrounds). Communicate through services — never direct Svelte↔Phaser calls.
- **Minimum tap target:** 44×44px equivalent.
- **Softlock prevention.** Every screen renders a dismiss / back control in all states (loading, error, empty, success). See `.claude/rules/ui-layout.md`.

## Svelte MCP
Before writing any `.svelte` component: call `mcp__svelte__list-sections`. For runes (`$state`, `$derived`, `$effect`, `$props`): fetch the relevant section first. For errors: check MCP before guessing.

## After-Change Checklist
1. Run typecheck + build.
2. Docker visual verify at 1920×1080 per `.claude/rules/testing.md`.
3. Update `docs/ui/` per docs-first.
